## Design
#### What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
- I believe the most helpful thing about thinking about design methods of your projects is the use of the Design and UX powerpoint where I was able to fully understand what each design method. The methods we used, like the storyboard, allowed us to know what to expect from our bot.
#### What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
- I think the most difficult thing was understanding how to create the use cases. The issue was that we were not entirely familiar with the use cases when we were creating them. Our classmates definitely helped a lot when learning about how to go about this project.I think I would've looked into more examples into how to create them if I were to redo the entire project.
#### What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
- A design method I might want to try again in the future is the use cases as it provides a great opportunity to capture the user requirements.

## Implementation
#### What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
- I think the group would agree that the use cases and the storyboard are the most essential and helpful thing about implementing, testing, and integration of the project.
#### What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
- The most difficult thing about the implementation was figuring out the imports and how to use firestore for python. I believe none of the group members had previous experience in making a discord bot, and so understanding the entire process was difficult. I myself had to switch to a windows OS laptop in order to work and test the bot because some of the imports weren't working on the mac for some reason. One thing i would've done differently is lookig over everything when the class first started in order to give myself some time and room to learn before actually starting the implementation.
#### What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
- I would try using UML again if I were to try again in the futute or another project. I believe it helped us a lot, and so it is worth trying it again.

## Process
#### What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
- the Kanban github board was really helpful in that it allowed us to track eveerything that we were doing.
#### What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
- The most difficult thing was sometimes forgetting to mark down the things we've done. I would probably try to focus more on it in order not to forget about marking things/updating the to-do list
#### What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
- I think I would use the git branches a lot in future projects as it improves the organization of the repo. I would like to use the creation of the milestones for the project because it allows developers to stay on track and better prepare.

## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
- it is important to note that the group decided to go with what matched what we were working on. I believe use cases and storyboards were essential to our bot as it they illustrate what is needed from the bot and user requirements, as well the timeline and steps users take to perform certain tasks. certain design practices, like the personas, would not have helped as the design and the view schematic won't really matter to our bot since the view schematic and the layout would be the same for all discord bots, and so we did not use it. Another thing that wouldn't be useful to our project is the class diagrams as it we haven't done OOP. It WOULD work in some cases in similar projects, but I believe we used the right design processes effectively for our project.
